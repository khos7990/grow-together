<p>Grow Together is a web app designed for plant lovers of all levels. The goal is to help owners to select plants that are compatible with their existing collection so as to make intergration seamless and as unstressfull as possible.</p>

<p>By curating and matching one's plants to others like it based on watering needs, light requirements and level of maintenance necessary, the user can ensure that future plants fit will into their lifestyle and the aesthetic that they like most.</p>

<p> At the moment, our app has built into it a database of 10 common houseplants/indoor plants. Future goals would include increasing the scope of the database, exapanding matching critieria to consider plant compatbility in terms of pest control, and creating collections of plants based on type. Interaction between users and reviewing recommendations is also something to build upon.</p>
